## Where to start

This is the repository for the IEA Task 43 glossary on terms related to data and metadata.

If you'd like to add or alter terms, the best place to start is by joining the [IEA Task 43 Slack
community](ieawinddigitalization.slack.com) and asking some questions on there. Let us know what you
think should be added / changed and - more importantly - what problem this would solve for you.

Please also bear in mind that we're volunteers running this, so be kind and if you'd like to help
contribute, get involved in some of the IEA meetings - it'd be great to have you on board!

## Editing in GitBook (preferred)

GitBook is a user interface for editing and maintaining documents. It's based on Git, which means we have
full version control - but it's a friendly editor so **you don't have to learn how to use git or github**.

If you're already involved in Task 43, and want to edit this content, please ping Tom Clark
on [the Task 43 Slack Channel](ieawinddigitalization.slack.com) and he can add you to the editors list. 


## Editing on GitHub (advanced users only)

The glossary is managed by GitBook and stored in this open-source GitHub repository. 
If you have a text editor and prefer the command line to the GitBook User Interface, then 
please fork this repository, modify as required then make a pull request for your modifications!

The maintainers will evaluate your PR, check it renders correctly and accept or close as appropriate.
