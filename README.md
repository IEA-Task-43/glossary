# IEA Wind Task 43 Glossary

This is a glossary of terms for use by scientists and engineers in the wind energy industry.

If you're reading this on our GitHub repository - [you can find the published glossary here](https://iea-task-43.gitbook.io/iea-task-43-glossary/)!

The goal is to help improve our ability to digitalise analyses, processes and knowledge: ultimately to enable more effective communication and collaboration.

## About

During the Task 43 Metadata Challenge (and many other branches of the Task 43 work) it was recognised that a common set of definitions that the community could refer to would be very helpful - lots of discussion has gone on throughout various subtasks and meetings simply bringing people toward a common dialogue.

#### What This Glossary Is

* A collection of terms, with explanatory examples where appropriate, that attempts to capture (at sufficient detail, but without too much detail!) the meanings of phrases we use in conversations about data and digitalisation.
* An open resource for the entire wind industry.
* A reference for the collaborators in Task 43.

#### What This Glossary Is Not

* This is NOT a god-given set of definitions, each respecting the absolute tiniest intricacies.
* This is NOT comprehensive - we will never capture every single term around data, so we try to retain only those most useful to the community or where there seems to be most confusion.
* This is NOT absolutely correct - there are different definitions of these terms out in the world, and we've done our best but be wary of this when discussing terms with others, especially outside the circle of people who are engaged with Task 43. It's always worth being precise!

## About IEA Task 43 Wind

The International Energy Agency Wind Technology Collaboration Programme (IEA Wind TCP) is an international co-operation that shares information and research activities to advance wind energy research, development and deployment in member countries.

Task 43 is specifically focused on the issues of digitalization in wind energy:

> _Our mission is to help bring about a revolution in the way the wind energy industry uses technology. We aim to provide a platform for dissemination of great ideas, best practices and collaboration. Specifically we are working to understand the optimal pathways for the adoption of digital technologies such as:_
