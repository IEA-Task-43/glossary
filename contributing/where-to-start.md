# Where to start

If you'd like to add or alter terms, the best place to start is by joining the [IEA Task 43 Slack community](slack:ieawinddigitalization.slack.com) and asking some questions on there.

Let us know what you think should be added / changed and - more importantly - **what problem this would solve for you**.

Please also bear in mind that we're volunteers running this, so be kind and if you'd like to help contribute, get involved in some of the IEA meetings - it'd be great to have you on board!

If you're already involved in Task 43, and want to edit this content, please ping Tom Clark on slack and he can add you to the editors on GitBook. Alternatively you could just edit the raw docs directly on GitHub
