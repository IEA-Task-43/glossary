# Vocabulary

Set of agreed upon set of words describing data, together with the corresponding definition of each word.



{% hint style="danger" %}
A vocabulary is often referred to as a dictionary. However, "dictionary" has further meaning in the sense that it could be interpreted as a reference for all terms (rather than a specific set), or interpreted as a key-value store by programmers. So we encourage the use of "vocabulary" for this purpose.
