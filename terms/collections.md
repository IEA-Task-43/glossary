# Semantics

Agreed upon, often hierarchical, set of terms and structures to descibe data. This includes [vocabulary](vocabulary.md), [schema](schema.md), [taxonomies][taxonomy.md], and [ontologies][ontology.md]

A way to interpret signs and symbols (to confer them sense and meaning) within particular context. Semantics relies on the rules of [syntax](syntax.md), for machine readability.

The choice of semantics depends on context and pragmatics.

For example, semantics must be agreed upon to determine if a tomatoe is a fruit or a vegetable.
