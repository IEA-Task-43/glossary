# Semantics

Agreed upon, often hierarchical, [vocabulary](change-requests.md).

A way to interpret signs and symbols (to confer them sense and meaning) within particular context. Semantics relies on the rules of [syntax](the-gitbook-editor.md), for this interpretation.

The choice of semantics depends on context and pragmatics.
