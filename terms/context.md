# Context and Contextual Metadata

Contextual metadata refers to a subset of structural [metadata][metadata.md] meant to provide richer metadata. 

Conext is a broad term. From [Merriam Webster][1]: In its earliest uses (documented in the 15th century), context meant "the weaving together of words in language." This sense, now obsolete, developed logically from the word's source in Latin, contexere "to weave or join together." Context now most commonly refers to the environment or setting in which something (whether words or events) exists. When we say that something is contextualized, we mean that it is placed in an appropriate setting, one in which it may be properly considered.
