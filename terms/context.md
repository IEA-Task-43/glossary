# Context

Modern data relies on context to be understood. A human has no way to interact with hard drives of data without a computer. The computer is built to understand the state of the hard drive as data, which can be visualized and manipulated by a human. Humans store data on computers so that it can be later accessed by themselves or other humans, usually for a preconceived purpose. It is useful to encode contextual information alongside raw data. This contextual information can include anything from the data structure to uncertainty in anticipated insights from the data.

Contextual [metadata][metadata.md] refers to a subset of metadata meant to provide richer metadata.
