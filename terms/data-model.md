# Data Model

A data model is an abstract model that organises elements of data and standardises how they relate to one another and to the properties of real-world entities. For instance, a data model may specify that the data element representing a car be composed of a number of other elements which, in turn, represent the colour and size of the car and define its owner.

**Disambiguation**

The term "data model" has a variety of meanings depending on context.\
\
In the context of ML/AI or data fitting (a common practice within the area of digitalisation) a data model is an entirely different concept: it's a representation of a dataset itself (like a fitted hypersurface) which can be used as a rapid lookup.\
\
Even within the context of knowledge engineering, the interpretation of "data model" isn't clear - for example, [this discussion](https://medium.com/p/3bab439132cd) suggests that a "data model" is more conceptual than the more explicit "[schema](schema.md)" or "[ontology](ontology.md)".\


Within Task 43, there are a number of references to "data model" such as the WRA data model within Work Package 4. We see no need to retroactively change these, however.\
\
Going forward, use of the more explicit "schema" or "ontology" is preferred where appropriate.
