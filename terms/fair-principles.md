# FAIR principles

FAIR stands for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable. This is a set of guiding principles for data usage within the scientific community, particularly intended to promote automation and non-human use cases and well as easier human use of data. See [Wilkinson et. al. 2016](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618).

A superset of the FAIR principles are the [Gemini Principles](https://www.cdbb.cam.ac.uk/DFTG/GeminiPrinciples) from the UK's National Digital Twin project.
