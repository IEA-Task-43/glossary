# Taxonomy

A taxonomy models a [class](class.md) hierarchy. It is a classification scheme, especially a hierarchical classification, in which things are organized into groups or types.

<summary>TODO sort this mess of weird</summary>

Describes the relationship between different classes. What something “IS” rather than “HAS” (like in an ontology)

Hierarchical organization of data where domain knowledge is stored

It is a classification of a subject, generally with a hierarchical structure

Formalizes the hierarchical relationships among concepts and specifies the term to be used to refer to each; it prescribes structure and terminology \[references]

What’s the difference between taxonomy and ontology? Do we need both??&#x20;

**Note**

By organizing a [vocabulary][vocabulary.md] as a taxonomy, we can see how different entries are related to one another and how they fit into the overall structure of the vocabulary. This can make it easier to learn and use the vocabulary, and can also help understand the meanings of the entries and how they are used in different contexts. %}
