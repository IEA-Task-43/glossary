# Taxonomy

A taxonomy models a [class](class.md) hierarchy. It is a classification scheme, especially a hierarchical classification, in which things are organized into groups or types. A taxonomy is a type of terminology-based ontology, where different terms are related using a subset operator.

<summary>TODO sort this mess of weird</summary>

Describes the relationship between different classes. What something “IS” rather than “HAS” (like in an ontology)

Hierarchical organization of data where domain knowledge is stored

It is a classification of a subject, generally with a hierarchical structure

Formalizes the hierarchical relationships among concepts and specifies the term to be used to refer to each; it prescribes structure and terminology \[references]

What’s the difference between taxonomy and ontology? Do we need both??&#x20;
