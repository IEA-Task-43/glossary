# Syntax

A set of rules that defines the combinations of symbols that are considered to be correctly structured statements or expressions in a language or data format. Syntax therefore refers to the form of the data or code, and is contrasted with [semantics](collections.md) â€“ the meaning.

The following expresses semantically identical metadata using different syntaxes, in this case JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) and HTML (HyperText Markup Language) with opengraph attributes.

```
<head>
    <meta property="og:type" content="article">
    <meta name="description" content="Science to build on">
</head>
```

```
{
  "type": "article",
  "description": "Science to build on",
}
```

### Useful syntax for metadata

Subjectivity alert!!!! We think the following syntax will be useful for the Task 43 members but this is by no means exhaustive:

* [OWL (Web Ontology Language)](https://www.w3.org/TR/owl-semantics/syntax.html#:\~:text=An%20OWL%20ontology%20in%20the,imports%20references%20to%20other%20ontologies.)
* [JSON (Javascript Object Notation)](https://www.json.org/json-en.html)
* [OpenGraph](https://ogp.me)
