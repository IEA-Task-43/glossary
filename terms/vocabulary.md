# Vocabulary

Set of agreed upon set of words describing data, together with the corresponding definition of each word.

**Disambiguation**

A vocabulary is often referred to as a dictionary. However, "dictionary" has further meaning in the sense that it could be interpreted as a reference for all terms (rather than a specific set), or interpreted as a key-value store by programmers. So we encourage the use of "vocabulary" for this purpose.

**Note**

By organizing a vocabulary as a [taxonomy][taxonomy.md], we can see how different entries are related to one another and how they fit into the overall structure of the vocabulary. This can make it easier to learn and use the vocabulary, and can also help understand the meanings of the entries and how they are used in different contexts. %}
